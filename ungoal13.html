	<h1>Climate Action</h1> 
	<p>"Climate Change" This has been a buzz word globally ever since this idea was introduced. Just the thought that our world is slowly heating up can be extremely scary for some. Side effects of global warming include, extinction of animal species due to destruction of habitats, cities flooding and getting destroyed due to high-rising sea levels, and generally, global warming means doom. However, the can still be precautions for humans to take in order to prevent this process from being a total disaster. It's not too late yet. We as global citizens can work our fair shares to help this globe return to cleanliness. From taking the bus to eating less beef, these small steps all contribute to climate change being less of a problem. <br/></p>
	<p>Below is a chart that shows just how damaging climate change is:</p>

    <p>Climate Change is getting increasingly dangerous, and this piece of data can show that it can actually cause deaths. With this in mind, we need to act quick upon solutions to slow this inetivable process down. There are a few resolutions to reduce the harm of global warming, such as controlling deforestation and mass mining, regulating overconsumption, or managing waste disposal. Although none of these acts can fully stop climate change, it will definitely be beneficial to the earth. Our planet has been manipulated to the point of no return by us, and it is time to step up and do something. You can start off with small donations to researchers of climate change or just walk more instead of driving. Remember, every big act starts with a small first step.</p>
