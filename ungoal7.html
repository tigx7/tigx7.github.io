	<h1>Affordable & Clean Energy</h1>
	<p>As industrialization develops, industrial waste is inevitable. This type of pollution can be produced by materials such as carbon, wood, fossil fuels... These materials will generate pollution, and moreover, they will eventually run out. As we rely so heavily upon them, running out of materials would seem like quite literally the end of the world. The good thing is that we have other ways to create energy. They come in forms such as wind, solar, or even hydroelectric energy. They don't create air pollution, and will never run out. These sources of power are a solution to many world problems, which is why switching to them will benefit our lives massively. </p>
	<p>Using Data collected from the World Health Organizatio, I created this graph below to show the amount of pollution non-renewable energies can produce:<br/>
	<p>Amount of P.M 2.5 particles (Air Pollution) per square centimeter in the air of different UN Regions</p>

    <p>Particulate Matter (P.M 2.5) is a very hazardous subtance if inhaled, and it is polluting the air due to the burning of fossil fuels and carbon. A study conducted by Cambridge University has proven that over 10 particles per square centimeter can cause short term and long term harms to the human body. However, when using the chart, it shows that only 1 out of 11 regions in the world have a healthy level of P.M 2.5. This can cause health risks such as irritation, asthma, lung disfunction, or even direct death if inhaled for a long time. This is a major issue in the world right now, and switching to clean energy sources can be a resolution.</p>
