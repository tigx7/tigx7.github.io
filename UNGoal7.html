	<h1>Affordable & Clean Energy</h1>
	<p>As industrialization develops, industrial waste is inevitable. This type of pollution can be produced by materials such as carbon, wood, fossil fuels... These materials will generate pollution, and moreover, they will eventually run out. As we rely so heavily upon them, running out of materials would seem like quite literally the end of the world. The good thing is that we have other ways to create energy. They come in forms such as wind, solar, or even hydroelectric energy. They don't create air pollution, and will never run out. These sources of power are a solution to many world problems, which is why switching to them will benefit our lives massively. </p>
